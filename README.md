# Operation Tarot Scripts
## By Charlie Cook
## For Scene "Temperance"

### Description

These C# scripts are the backbone of my scene in my Unity group project Operation Tarot, made for COMP 5300: Special Topics: Augmented & Virtual Reality, held in the Spring of 2021 at UMass Lowell.
In my scene, Temperance (based on the eponymous tarot card), you play a pilgrim on a *villa rustica*, or farm house, in Pax-Romana-era Rome, and a minor god of the harvest, Messor, instructs you to cut a certain amount of wheat from a nearby field.
You do this by picking up a sickle, which is a SteamVR interactable object, and colliding it into the models of wheat to "cut" them.
Once you reach the limit, Messor will reveal a "wonder" to you, and you can proceed to one of the other scenes made by my groupmates.

### How To Play (the actual game)

1. You can download a build of my scene only from my personal Nextcloud repository, linked [here](https://cculysses.com/nextcloud/index.php/s/fAAgzWzc49BJBrT)
2. Extract the build to anywhere, and run "Operation Tarot.exe" to play
3. You will need SteamVR installed and a compatible headset to SteamVR to fully play, and at least one hand controller to move around with either a control stick or circular touchpad
4. When finished, press Alt and F4 to close the Unity window.
5. Please note that this build only has my scene in it, and thus the cards at the end will not lead to my groupmates scenes; this was done to save on filesize.

### Sources

All of these scripts were written line-by-line by me, Charles "Charlie" Cook, though for **VirScript.cs** I did follow along with a video by Youtube User "VR With Andrew".
That video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvuI6fspGMM).
